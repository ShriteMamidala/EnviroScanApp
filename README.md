## 🐝 Inspiration

Just like bees scan their surroundings to find and collect pollen 🌸, **EnviroScan** mimics this natural behavior to identify and classify waste in the environment. Through **AI-powered image recognition**, it helps users dispose of waste properly — encouraging sustainability and cleaner communities.

---

## 🚀 What It Does

**EnviroScan** is a mobile app that:
- 📷 **Scans waste in real-time** using a phone camera.
- ♻️ **Identifies waste types** (plastic, paper, glass, metal, etc.).
- 🧭 **Guides users on how to dispose** of the material correctly.

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

- **Frontend**: Built with Flutter (Dart) for fast, responsive mobile UI.
- **Backend**: FastAPI processes images and connects the frontend to AI services.
- **AI Model**: YOLOv5 segmentation trained on the **TACO dataset** to detect and classify trash items.

## 📝 Notes

> 📱 In the demo video, the app is shown running on an Android emulator — it's not yet published to an app store.
